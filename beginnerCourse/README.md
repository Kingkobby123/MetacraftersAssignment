## Prerequisites

Ethereum Wallet or Development Environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle)

Solidity Compiler (0.8.18 or compatible)

## Installing

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bankuCoin-token.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd bankuCoin-token

## Executing

Open the bankuCoin.sol file in your preferred Solidity development environment.

Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler (0.8.18 or compatible).

Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network using your chosen method (Remix, Truffle, etc.).
